Txt2tags PO and POT files
-------------------------

These are the txt2tags program i18n files, which allows it
to be translated to other languages besides english.

txt2tags.pot
	The main translation file, with all the messages
	needed to be translated
	
*.po
	The translated messages for some languages


  NOTE: The procedures to install on Linux as non-root
  and in Windows were provided by Andreas Deininger
  (andreas@deininger.net).

-----------------------------------------------------------

To translate txt2tags to your language:

1. Search which is the ID for your language. For example,
   "es" is for spanish, "de" is for german.

2. Copy the "txt2tags.pot" file as "<ID>.po".

3. Fill the "<ID>.po" file headers with your data.

4. Fill all the "msgstr" lines with the translations.

5. Use the "msgfmt -c --statistics <ID>.po" command to check
   the file syntax.

6. Follow the next steps to compile and install the
   messages on your system and test them.

7. Send the .po file to the txt2tags author, so it can be
   officially included on the program distribution and you
   will be part of the txt2tags team.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To update your translation when txt2tags.pot is updated:

1. Download http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/po/txt2tags.pot

2. Run:
   msgmerge --no-fuzzy-matching <ID>.po txt2tags.pot > new.po

3. Edit new.po and fill the new messages that are empty.

4. Use the "msgfmt -c --statistics new.po" command to check
   the file syntax.

5. When everything is OK, rename new.po to <ID>.po.

6. Send the .po file to the txt2tags author, or commit the
   changes to the repository if you have access to txt2tags
   SVN.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To install the translation file in your system:

Linux (as root):

  1. Search where is the locale directory. For most systems
     it is "/usr/share/locale/".

  2. Compile the .po into a .mo file with the following
     command: "msgfmt -o txt2tags.mo <ID>.po"

  3. Move the .mo file to the locale directory, under the
     "<ID>/LC_MESSAGES/" directory, for example:
     "mv txt2tags.mo /usr/share/locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES/"

  4. Make sure your system is configured to the same
     language of your translation.
     Hint: "/etc/sysconfig/i18n"

  5. Run txt2tags and check if it worked!


Linux (as plain user):

  If you do not have root privileges on your system, proceed
  the previous, but on the step 3 you will have to do:
  
  3. Locate the following two lines at the top of the Python
     script for txt2tags (the file is usually called txt2tags)
   
     # if your locale dir is different, change it here
     cat = gettext.Catalog('txt2tags',localedir='/usr/share/locale/')

     Instead of '/usr/share/locale', put in:
     '/path/to/txt2tags/po'
   
     Under the po directory create a subdirectory:
     "<ID>/LC_MESSAGES/" and move <ID>.mo to this newly
     created directory


Windows:

  1. Point your browser to the GNU gettext website, located
     at http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ and download
     the Windows versions of the packages gettext-runtime
     and libiconv.
  
  2. Unpack the zip-files.
  
  3. From the bin directories created, move all DLL's to
     your system32 directory of your Windows installation
     (charset.dll, iconv.dll, gettextlib.dll, gettextpo.dll,
     gettextsrc.dll)
  
  4. Compile the <ID>.po into a .mo file with the following
     command: "msgfmt -o txt2tags.mo <ID>.po"
  
     Note: in order to do that, you need to download the
     gettext-tools, too. Alternatively, you can use the
     Cygwin or the Mingw environment, which both provide the
     msgfmt command, too.
  
  5. Under your txt2tags directory, create a subdirectory:
     "locale/<LANG>/LC_MESSAGES/" and move <ID>.mo to this 
     newly created directory
  
  6. Locate the following two lines at the top of the Python
     script for txt2tags (the file is usually called txt2tags)
     
     # if your locale dir is different, change it here
     cat = gettext.Catalog('txt2tags',localedir='/usr/share/locale/')
  
     Replace these two lines with:
  
     # patch to make gettext work on Windows
     basepath = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0]))
     localedir = os.path.join(basepath, "locale")
     gettext.bindtextdomain('txt2tags', localedir)
     gettext.textdomain('txt2tags')
     
  6. Add "LANGUAGE" as an environment variable to your system and 
     assign the value <ID> to it.
     This can be achieved via the following steps:
  
     a) Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties. 
        (Alternatively, you may choose Start-Settings-Control 
         Panel-System)
     b) Click the Advanced tab.
     c) Click Environment variables.
     d) Click New to add a new variable name and value. The name 
        should be LANG and the value is language code (e.g. "de")
  
  7. Run txt2tags and check if it worked!
