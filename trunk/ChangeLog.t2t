Txt2tags ChangeLog


%%%
This file generates two versions of the ChangeLog:

TXT: Goes in the root of the txt2tags package (tarball). To improve
     readability, URLs, revision/issue numbers and "thank you" messages
     are removed.

HTML: The full version, used in the txt2tags website. This file contents
      are included by another web/changelog.t2t file, who have some
      filters to improve the formatting. That's why you don't see html
      filters here.
%%% 

%!target: aat
%!encoding: utf-8

%!options(aat): -o ChangeLog

% Stars as list bullets are nicer
