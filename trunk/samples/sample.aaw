This text is before the introduction.

But it's OK.


                            +--------------+
                            | Introduction |
                            +--------------+

Welcome to the txt2tags sample file.

Here you have examples and a brief explanation of all
marks.

The first 3 lines of the this file are used as headers,
on the following format:

  line1: document title
  line2: author name, email
  line3: date, version

Lines with balanced equal signs = around are titles.


                       +-----------------------+
                       | Fonts and Beautifiers |
                       +-----------------------+

We have two sets of fonts:

The NORMAL type that can be improved with beautifiers.

The TYPEWRITER type that uses monospaced font for
pre-formatted text.

We will now enter on a subtitle...


Beautifiers
===========

The text marks for beautifiers are simple, just as you
type on a plain text email message.

We use double *, /, - and _ to represent *bold*,
/italic/, -strike- and _underline_.

The */bold italic/* style is also supported as a
combination.


Pre-Formatted Text
==================

We can put a code sample or other pre-formatted text:

    here    is     pre-formatted
  //marks// are  **not**  ``interpreted``

And also, it's easy to put a one line pre-formatted
text:

  prompt$ ls /etc

Or use pre-formatted inside sentences.


More Cosmetics
==============

Special entities like email (<a href="mailto:duh@somewhere.com">duh@somewhere.com</a>) and
URL (<a href="http://www.duh.com">http://www.duh.com</a>) are detected automagically,
as long as the horizontal line:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

^ thin or large v

========================================================================

You can also specify an <a href="http://duh.org">explicit link</a>
or an <a href="mailto:duh@somewhere.com">explicit email</a> with label.

And remember,

        A TAB in front of the line does a quotation.

                More TABs, more depth (if allowed).


Nice.


                               +-------+
                               | Lists |
                               +-------+

A list of items is natural, just putting a *dash* or
a *plus* at the beginning of the line.


Plain List
==========

The dash is the default list identifier. For sublists,
just add *spaces* at the beginning of the line. More
spaces, more sublists.

- Earth
  - America
    - South America
      - Brazil
        - How deep can I go?
  - Europe
    - Lots of countries
- Mars
  - Who knows?

The list ends with *two* consecutive blank lines.


Numbered List
=============

The same rules as the plain list, just a different
identifier (plus).

1. one
2. two
3. three
  - mixed lists!
  - what a mess
    1. counting again
    2. ...
4. four


Definition List
===============

The definition list identifier is a colon, followed by
the term. The term contents is placed on the next line.

orange
  a yellow fruit
apple
  a green or red fruit
other fruits
  - wee!
  - mixing lists
    1. again!
    2. and again!


                               +--------+
                               | Tables |
                               +--------+

Use pipes to compose table rows and cells.
Double pipe at the line beginning starts a heading row.
Natural spaces specify each cell alignment.

                +-----------+-------------+------------+                
                | heading 1 |  heading 2  |  heading 3 |                
                +===========+=============+============+                
                | cell 1.1  |  cell 1.2   |   cell 1.3 |                
                +-----------+-------------+------------+                
                | cell 2.1  |  cell 2.2   |   cell 2.3 |                
                +-----------+-------------+------------+                

Without the last pipe, no border:

                 ----------- ------------- ------------                 
                  heading 1    heading 2     heading 3                  
                 =========== ============= ============                 
                  cell 1.1     cell 1.2       cell 1.3                  
                 ----------- ------------- ------------                 
                  cell 2.1     cell 2.2       cell 2.3                  
                 ----------- ------------- ------------                 


                          +------------------+
                          | Special Entities |
                          +------------------+

Because things were too simple.


Images
======

The image mark is as simple as it can be: [filename].

                      <img src="img/photo.jpg" alt=""/>  

And with some targets the image is linkable :

                      <a href="http://www.txt2tags.org"><img src="img/photo.jpg" alt=""/></a>  

- The filename must end in PNG, JPG, GIF, or similar.
- No spaces inside the brackets!


Other
=====

When the target needs, special chars like &lt;, &gt; and &amp;
are escaped.

The handy %%date macro expands to the current date.

So today is 20110707 on the ISO YYYYMMDD format.

You can also specify the date format with the %? flags,
as %%date(%m-%d-%Y) which gives: 07-07-2011.

That's all for now.
