<h1>
  Limitations and known issues
</h1>

<p>Disclamer: As the reTxt2tags tool is derived from reMarkdown CSS, most of the details here are no longer relevant.</p>

<p>
  ReTxt2tags was tested on recent versions of modern browsers. It works well
  in all browsers with complete CSS 2.1 support, including IE8. It will
  degrade not-so-gracefully in IE7.
</p>

<h2>
  Browser-specific issues
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    IE8 does not render generated content in HR elements. Your horizontal
    rules will be invisible in that browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    IE8, in print mode, has trouble with the overflowing “&gt;” signs of
    blockquotes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spotted a few issues when printing in Firefox 4b on OSX. I opened two bug
    reports and both were fixed (yay!), so Firefox 4 final should be ok.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spotted a few minor issues when printing in Opera 11 on OSX.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Underlined headings
</h2>

<p>
  To achieve the style of underlined H1 and H2 elements, I had to pick one of
  the various position schemes/behaviors/display modes/etc. of CSS that
  restrict an element’s width to the width of its contents. All of the options
  I could figure out had unwanted side effects. I settled for
  <code>display:inline-block</code> but it’s far from a perfect solution. Two
  consequences:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Spacing above and below titles may be off in a few configurations (issues
    caused by the lack of margin collapsing).
  </li>
  <li>
    Having two underlined headings in a row is dangerous. Typically, an
    underlined H2 following an underlined H1 might end up on the same line. So
    such H2 elements are switched back to <code>display:block</code> (a very
    dirty fix).
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
  Lists
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Ordered lists use a custom CSS counter, not the default counter. Only way
    to change the counter style (from numeric to roman or something else) is
    to change the CSS for “retxt2tagsed” OLs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>start</code> attribute of OL elements is ignored. If you know a
    way to use it in a CSS counter, email me.
  </li>
</ul>
