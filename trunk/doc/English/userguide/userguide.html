<A NAME="1st-questions"></A>
<H2>The First Questions You May Have</H2>

<P>
This chapter is a txt2tags overview, that will introduce the program
purpose and features.
</P>

<H3>What is it?</H3>

<P>
Txt2tags is a text formatting and conversion tool.
</P>
<P>
Txt2tags converts a plain text file with little marks, to any
of the supported targets:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>HTML document
<LI>XHTML document
<LI>SGML document
<LI>LaTeX document
<LI>UNIX man page
<LI>MagicPoint presentation
<LI>Wikipedia page (MediaWiki)
<LI>Google Wiki page
<LI>DokuWiki page
<LI>MoinMoin page
<LI>PageMaker 6.0 document
<LI>Plain Text (no marks)
</UL>

<H3>Why should I use it?</H3>

<P>
You'll find txt2tags really useful if you:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Need to publish documents on different formats
<LI>Need to maintain updated documents on different formats
<LI>Write technical or manual documents
<LI>Don't know how to write a document on a certain format
<LI>Don't have a specific editor for a certain format
<LI>Want to use a simple text editor to update your documents
</UL>

<P>
And the main motivation is:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Save time, writing <B>contents</B> and forgetting about <B>formatting</B>
</UL>

<H3>Why is it a good choice among other tools?</H3>

<P>
Txt2tags has a very straight way of growing, following basic concepts.
These are the highlights:

<A NAME="targets"></A>
<H2>Supported Targets</H2>

<DL>
<DT><B>HTML</B></DT><DD>
  Everybody knows what HTML is. (hint: Internet)
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates clean HTML documents, that look pretty and have
  its source readable. It DOES NOT use javascript, frames or other
  futile formatting techniques, that aren't required for simple, techie
  documents. But a separate CSS file can be used if wanted. Txt2tags
  generates "<I>HTML 4.0 Transitional</I>" code.
<P></P>
  Since version 2.0, the txt2tags HTML generated code is 100% approved
  by the <A HREF="http://validator.w3.org/">w3c validator</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>XHTML</B></DT><DD>
  It is the new generation of HTML, with more strict rules, as to close
  all the tags you open. This makes the code easier to parse and
  understand. For the general purpose, consider it HTML. Txt2tags
  generates "<I>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</I>" code.
<P></P>
  Since version 2.0, the txt2tags XHTML generated code is 100% approved
  by the <A HREF="http://validator.w3.org/">w3c validator</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>SGML</B></DT><DD>
  It is a common document format which has powerful conversion applications
  (<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/etch/linuxdoc-tools">linuxdoc-tools</A>). From a
  single SGML file you can generate HTML, PDF, PostScript, Info, LaTeX, LyX, RTF
  and XML documents. The tools also does automatic TOC and break
  sections into subpages.
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates SGML files in the LinuxDoc system type, ready to
  be converted with linuxdoc-tools without any extra catalog files or any
  SGML annoying requirements.
<P></P>
<DT><B>LATEX</B></DT><DD>
  The preferred academic document format, it is more powerful than you
  ever wondered. Full books, complicated formulas and any complex text
  can be written in LaTeX. But prepare to lost your hair if you will try
  to write the tags by hand...
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates ready-to-use LaTeX files, doing all the complex
  escaping tricks and exceptions. The writer just need to worry about
  the text.
<P></P>
<DT><B>LOUT</B></DT><DD>
  Very similar to LaTeX in power, but with an easier syntax using "@"
  instead "\" and avoiding the need of braces in common situations. Its
  approach of everything-is-an-object makes the tagging much saner.
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates ready-to-use Lout files, which can be converted do
  PS or PDF files using the "lout" command.
<P></P>
<DT><B>MAN</B></DT><DD>
  UNIX man pages resist over the years. Document formats come and go,
  and there they are, unbeatable.
<P></P>
  There are other tools to generate man documents, but txt2tags has
  one advantage: one source, multi targets. So the same man page
  contents can be converted to a HTML page, MagicPoint presentation, etc.
<P></P>
<DT><B>MGP</B></DT><DD>
  <A HREF="http://www.mew.org/mgp">MagicPoint</A> is a very handy presentation tool
  (hint: Microsoft PowerPoint), that uses a tagged language to define all
  the screens. So you can do complex presentations in vi/emacs/notepad.
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates a ready-to-use .mgp file, defining all the
  necessary headers for fonts and appearance definitions, as long as
  ISO-8859 accents support.
<P></P>
  <B>HOTSPOT 1:</B> txt2tags created .mgp file uses the XFree86 Type1
  fonts! So you do not need to carry TrueType fonts files with your
  presentation.
<P></P>
  <B>HOTSPOT 2:</B> the color definitions for fonts are clean, so even on a
  poor color palette system (as <CODE>startx -- -bpp 8</CODE>), the presentation
  will look pretty!
<P></P>
  The key is: convert and use. No quick fixes or requirements needed.
<P></P>
<DT><B>WIKI</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
  You've heard about the <A HREF="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</A>, right? So you
  don't need to learn yet-another markup syntax. Just stick with txt2tags
  and let it convert your text to the Wikipedia format, called
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>GWIKI</B></DT><DD>
  Now you can easily paste your project's current documentation into the
  <A HREF="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</A> Wiki.
<P></P>
<DT><B>DOKU</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
  <A HREF="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</A> is a standards
  compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at creating documentation
  of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small
  companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the
  datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of
  structured texts. All data is stored in plain text files - no
  database is required.
<P></P>
<DT><B>MOIN</B></DT><DD>
  You don't know what <A HREF="http://moinmo.in/">MoinMoin</A> is?
  It is a <A HREF="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki">WikiWiki</A>!
<P></P>
  Moin syntax is kinda boring when you need to keep
  <CODE>{{{'''''adding braces and quotes'''''}}}</CODE>, so txt2tags comes with the
  simplified marks and unified solution: one source, multi targets.
<P></P>
<DT><B>PM6</B></DT><DD>
  I guess you didn't know, but Adobe PageMaker 6.0 has its own tagged
  language! Styles, color table, beautifiers, and most of all the
  PageMaker mouse-clicking features are available on its tagged language
  also. You just need to access "Import tagged text" menu item. Just for
  the records, it's an &lt;HTML "like"&gt; tag format.
<P></P>
  Txt2tags generates all the tags and already defines a extensive and
  working header, setting paragraph styles and formatting. This is the
  hard part. <B>GOTCHA:</B> No line breaks! A paragraph must be one single
  line.
<P></P>
  Author's note:
  <I>My entire portuguese <A HREF="http://guia-er.sf.net">regular expression's book</A></I>
  <I>was written in VI, converted to PageMaker with txt2tags and went to</I>
  <I>press.</I>
<P></P>
<DT><B>TXT</B></DT><DD>
  TXT is text. The only true formatting type.
<P></P>
  Although txt2tags marks are very intuitive and discrete, you can remove
  them by converting the file to pure TXT.
<P></P>
  The titles are underlined, and the text is basically left as is on the
  source.

<H2>The Three User Interfaces: Gui, Web and Command Line</H2>

<P>
As different users have different needs and environments, txt2tags is
very flexible on how it runs.
</P>
<P>
There are three User Interfaces for the program, each one with its own
purpose and features.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Gui</B>: Written in Tk, brings the windowing and clicking to txt2tags.
<LI><B>Web</B>: Written in PHP, allows users to run txt2tags on the browser,
           requiring no installation on the client side.
<LI><B>Command Line</B>: Written in Python, it's the program core. All
           features are available as command line options.
</UL>

<A NAME="gui"></A>
<H3>Graphical Tk Interface</H3>

<P>
Since version 1.0, there is a nice Graphical Interface, that works on
Linux, Windows, Mac and others.
</P>
<P>
The program detects automatically if your system can display the
interface, and it is launched when called with no arguments. One can
force the Graphical Interface call with the <CODE>--gui</CODE> option. If some
resources are missing, the program will tell.
</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note:</B> The Tkinter module is needed. As it comes with the
	standard Python distribution, you may already have it.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The interface is pretty simple and intuitive:
</P>
                     <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./gui.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center>  

<OL>
<LI>You locate the source .t2t file on the disk and its options are
  loaded.
<P></P>
<LI>If the target is still empty, you must choose one.
<P></P>
<LI>Then there are some options you may choose, but none of them are
  required.
<P></P>
<LI>Finally, press the "Convert!" button.
</OL>

<P>
A nice option to check is the "<I>Dump to screen</I>", so you can check
the resulting code on a separate window, no file is saved at all. When
the code is OK, you uncheck it and the file will be saved.
</P>
<P>
The default interface colors can be changed on the <CODE>~/.txt2tagsrc</CODE>
file, using the <CODE>%!guicolors</CODE> settings. For example:
</P>

<PRE>
% set my own colors for the graphical interface (bg1, fg1, bg2, fg2)
%!guicolors: blue white brown yellow
</PRE>

<H3>Web Interface</H3>

<P>
The Web Interface is up and running on the Internet at
http://txt2tags.sf.net/online.php, so you can use and test the program
instantly, before download.
</P>
          <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./web.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center>  
<P>
One can also put this interface on the local intranet avoiding to
install txt2tags in all machines.
</P>

<A NAME="cmdline"></A>
<H3>Command Line Interface</H3>

<P>
For command line power users, the --help should be enough:
</P>

<PRE>
Usage: txt2tags [OPTIONS] [infile.t2t ...]

  -t, --target=TYPE   set target document type. currently supported:
                      html, xhtml, sgml, tex, lout, man, mgp, wiki,
                      gwiki, doku, moin, pm6, txt
  -i, --infile=FILE   set FILE as the input file name ('-' for STDIN)
  -o, --outfile=FILE  set FILE as the output file name ('-' for STDOUT)
  -n, --enum-title    enumerate all title lines as 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc
  -H, --no-headers    suppress header, title and footer contents
      --headers       show header, title and footer contents (default ON)
      --encoding      set target file encoding (utf-8, iso-8859-1, etc)
      --style=FILE    use FILE as the document style (like HTML CSS)
      --css-sugar     insert CSS-friendly tags for HTML and XHTML targets
      --css-inside    insert CSS file contents inside HTML/XHTML headers
      --mask-email    hide email from spam robots. x@y.z turns &lt;x (a) y z&gt;
      --toc           add TOC (Table of Contents) to target document
      --toc-only      print document TOC and exit
      --toc-level=N   set maximum TOC level (depth) to N
      --rc            read user config file ~/.txt2tagsrc (default ON)
      --gui           invoke Graphical Tk Interface
  -q, --quiet         quiet mode, suppress all output (except errors)
  -v, --verbose       print informative messages during conversion
  -h, --help          print this help information and exit
  -V, --version       print program version and exit
      --dump-config   print all the config found and exit

Turn OFF options:
     --no-outfile, --no-infile, --no-style, --no-encoding, --no-headers
     --no-toc, --no-toc-only, --no-mask-email, --no-enum-title, --no-rc
     --no-css-sugar, --no-css-inside, --no-quiet

Example:
     txt2tags -t html --toc myfile.t2t

By default, converted output is saved to 'infile.&lt;target&gt;'.
Use --outfile to force an output file name.
If  input file is '-', reads from STDIN.
If output file is '-', dumps output to STDOUT.

<A NAME="install"></A>
<H1>Part II - OK, I want it. Now what?</H1>

<P>
Just download the program and run it on your machine.
</P>

<A NAME="download-python"></A>
<H2>Download &amp; Install Python</H2>

<P>
First of all, you must download and install the Python interpreter on
your system. If you already have it, just skip this step.
</P>
<P>
Python is one of the nicest programming languages out there, it works on
Windows, Linux, UNIX, Macintosh, and others and it can be downloaded
from the <A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python web site</A>. Installation hints are
found on the same site. Txt2tags works with Python version 2.0 or newer.
</P>
<P>
If you are not sure if you have Python or not, open a console (tty,
xterm, MSDOS) and type <CODE>python</CODE>. If it is not installed, the system
will tell you.
</P>

<A NAME="download-txt2tags"></A>
<H2>Download txt2tags</H2>

<P>
The official location for txt2tags distribution is on the program
site, at http://txt2tags.sf.net.
</P>
<P>
All the program's files are on the tarball (.tgz file), which can be
expanded by most of the compression utilities (including Winzip).
</P>
<P>
Just get the <B>latest</B> one (more recent date, higher version number).
The previous versions remains for historical purposes only.
</P>

<A NAME="install-txt2tags"></A>
<H2>Install txt2tags</H2>

<P>
As a single Python script, txt2tags needs no installation at all.
</P>
<P>
The only file needed to use the program is the txt2tags script. The
other files of the tarball are documentation, tools and sample files.
</P>
<P>
The fail-proof way to run txt2tags, is calling Python with it:
</P>

<PRE>
prompt$ python txt2tags
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to "install" txt2tags on the system as a stand alone
program, just copy (or link) the txt2tags script to a System PATH
directory and make sure the system knows how to run it.
</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>UNIX/Linux/Mac</B></DT><DD>
  Make the script executable (<CODE>chmod +x txt2tags</CODE>) and copy it to a
  $PATH directory (<CODE>cp txt2tags /usr/local/bin</CODE>)
<P></P>
<DT><B>Windows</B></DT><DD>
  Rename the script adding the .py extension
  (<CODE>ren txt2tags txt2tags.py</CODE>) and copy it to a system PATH directory
  (<CODE>copy txt2tags.py C:\WINNT</CODE>)
</DL>

<P>
After that, you can create an icon on your desktop for it, if you want to
use the program's Graphical Interface.
</P>

<H3>Special Packages for Windows Users</H3>

<P>
There is also two .EXE distribution files for txt2tags, which install
the program on Windows machines with just a few clicks:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The single txt2tags script for those who already have the Python
  interpreted installed
<LI>The stand alone version, which doesn't require Python interpreter to
  run (it has a diet version embedded)
</UL>

<P>
Please visit the <I>Txt2tags-Win</I> site to download this packages:
<A HREF="http://txt2tags-win.sf.net">http://txt2tags-win.sf.net</A>
</P>

<A NAME="editor-syntax"></A>
<H2>Install Text Editor Syntax Highlighting File</H2>

<P>
Txt2tags comes with handy syntax highlighting files to be used by the
following text editors:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Vim (<A HREF="http://www.vim.org">www.vim.org</A>)
<LI>Emacs (<A HREF="http://www.emacs.org">www.emacs.org</A>)
<LI>Nano (<A HREF="http://www.nano-editor.org">www.nano-editor.org</A>)

<LI>TextMate (<A HREF="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</A>)
</UL>

<P>
This syntax highlighting files have all the txt2tags rules and marks
registered, helping the user to write error-free documents. Showing the
marks in colors, you see on-the-fly if you wrote it right.

<H1>Part III - Writing and Converting Your First Document</H1>

<H2>Check the Tools</H2>

<P>
To make the first conversion you will need three things: txt2tags, a
text editor and a web browser.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Make sure txt2tags is installed and running on your system.
<P></P>
  <UL>
  <LI><B>Command Line Interface:</B> Call "txt2tags" on the command line and
    the program should give you a "Missing input file" message. If it is
    not working, try "python /path/to/txt2tags" or even "/path/to/python
    /path/to/txt2tags" case Python is not on your PATH.
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>Gui Interface:</B> Click on the program icon to launch the Gui
    Interface.
  <P></P>
  </UL>
<LI>Open the text editor your are comfortable with. It can be <B>any</B> text
  editor, from the good old VI to MS Word or OpenOffice.org. Create a
  brand new empty document to be your first txt2tags one.
<P></P>
<LI>Launch your favorite web browser to see the results of the conversion
  to an HTML page.
</OL>

<H2>Write the Document Header</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Go to the text editor and on the very first line type the document
  main title: <I>My First Document</I>
<LI>On the second line make a subtitle, inserting this text:
  <I>A txt2tags test</I>
<LI>Then, on the third line, put some time information, as:
  <I>Sunday, 2004</I>
</OL>

<P>
If everything went right, you should be seeing a three line document
with this contents:
</P>

<PRE>
My First Document
A txt2tags test
Sunday, 2004
</PRE>

<P>
This is just a part of the document, but we can already convert it and
check the results.
</P>
<P>
Now save this document with the name <CODE>test.txt</CODE>. Pay attention to
which folder you are saving the file, you will need to remember it soon.
</P>

<H2>The First Conversion - Gui Interface</H2>

<P>
If you are in the Command Line Interface, please skip this step and read
the next one.
</P>
<P>
If you are in the Gui Interface, follow this steps:
</P>
    <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./firstdoc.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center> 

<OL>
<LI>Press the "Browse" button and choose the <CODE>test.txt</CODE> you just saved
  (remember the folder!).
<LI>Back to the first screen, select "HTML page" on the "Target document
  type" combo.
<LI>Press the "Convert!" button.
</OL>

   <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./firstdoc-done.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center> 
<P>
A dialog box will appear, telling you that the file was converted
successfully. Note that the generated HTML page was saved on the same
folder as the text file, with the "html" extension.
</P>

<H2>The First Conversion - Command Line Interface</H2>

<P>
If you are in the Gui Interface, please skip this step and read the next
one.
</P>
<P>
If you are in the Command Line Interface, move to the folder where the
file was saved and type this command:
</P>

<PRE>
txt2tags  --target  html  test.txt
</PRE>

<P>
Note that there are spaces between the command parts, but no spaces
inside the "--target" string, it is an option. This option is followed
by the "html" string, which tells the program to what format your text
file will be converted. The last item is the text filename.
</P>
<P>
If the conversion was done, the results were saved to the <CODE>test.html</CODE>
file and then the program will show you the
"<I>txt2tags wrote test.html</I>" message. If not, it will tell about some
error you may have done when typing the command line. Check it with
attention.
</P>
<P>
Here is a sample of how it will be shown on your screen:
</P>

<PRE>
prompt$ txt2tags --target html test.txt
txt2tags wrote test.html
prompt$
</PRE>

<H2>Check the Results</H2>

<P>
Open the <CODE>test.html</CODE> file on the Web browser to check if everything
is ok.
</P>
   <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./firstdoc-html.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center> 
<P>
Here it is! You just typed three simple lines of text and txt2tags made
all the work to set the HTML page heading information. Text alignment,
sizes, spacing and appearance. See that the main title is placed at the
browser title bar also.
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TH>You write text, txt2tags does the rest ;)</TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Tip: You can also use CSS on HTML pages generated by txt2tags, so the
page appearance is 100% configurable.
</P>

<H2>Writing the Document Body</H2>

<P>
Now back to the text editor, the next step is to type the document
contents. You can write plain text as you normally do on email messages.
You will see that txt2tags recognizes paragraphs and list of items
automatically, you don't have to "mark" them.
</P>
<P>
Then again: save it, convert and check the results. This is the
development cycle of a document in txt2tags. You just focus on the
document contents, finishing documents faster than other editors. No
mouse clickings, no menus, windows, distraction.
</P>
<P>
Considering the following contents for the <CODE>test.txt</CODE> file, which is
only plain text, compare the generated HTML page:
</P>

<PRE>
My First Document
A txt2tags test
Sunday, 2004

Well, let's try this txt2tags thing.
I don't know what to write.

Mmmmmm, I know what I need to do now:
- Take a shower
- Eat a pizza
- Sleep
</PRE>

   <center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="./firstdoc-fullhtml.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center> 
<P>
You can write a full homepage with 0% of HTML knowledge. You don't need
to insert any tags. And more, the same text file can be converted to any
of the other txt2tags supported formats.
</P>
<P>
Besides plain text, txt2tags has some very simple marks, that you will
use when need some other formating or structures like bold, italic,
title, images, table and other. As a quick sample,
<CODE>**starts for bold**</CODE> and <CODE>== equals for title ==</CODE>. You can learn the
marks on the <A HREF="http://txt2tags.sf.net/markup.html">Txt2tags Markup Demo</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="concepts"></A>
<H1>Part IV - Mastering Txt2tags Concepts</H1>

<A NAME="areas"></A>
<H2>The .t2t document Areas</H2>

<P>
Txt2tags marked files are divided in 3 areas. Each area have its own
rules and purpose. They are:
</P>

<DL>
<DT><I>Header Area</I></DT><DD>
  Place for Document Title, Author, Version and Date information.
  (optional)
<DT><I>Config Area</I></DT><DD>
  Place for general Document Settings and Parser behavior modifiers.
  (optional)
<DT><I>Body Area</I></DT><DD>
  Place for the Document Content. (required)
</DL>

<P>
As seen above, the first two Areas are optional, being <I>Body Area</I>
the only required one.
</P>
<P>
The areas are delimited by special rules, which will be seen in detail
on the next chapter. For now, this is a graphical representation of the
areas on a document:
</P>

<PRE>
             ____________
            |            |
            |   HEADERS  |       1. First, the Headers
            |            |
            |   CONFIG   |       2. Then the Settings
            |            |
            |    BODY    |       3. And finally the Document Body,
            |            |
            |    ...     |          which goes until the end
            |    ...     |
            |____________|

</PRE>

<P>
In short, this is how the areas are defined:
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center">
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="center"><B>Headers</B></TD>
<TD>First 3 lines of the file, or the first line blank for No Headers.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="center"><B>Config</B></TD>
<TD>Begins right after the Header (4th or 2nd line) and ends when the <I>Body Area</I> starts.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="center"><B>Body</B></TD>
<TD>The first valid text line (not comment or setting) after the <I>Header Area</I>.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H3>Full Example</H3>

<PRE>
My nice doc Title
Mr. John Doe
Last Updated: %%mtime(%c)

%! Target  : html
%! Style   : fancy.css
%! Encoding: iso-8859-1
%! Options : --toc --enum-title

Hi! This is my test document.
Its content will end here.
</PRE>

<A NAME="headers-area"></A>
<H2>Header Area</H2>

<P>
Location:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Fixed position: <B>First 3 lines</B> of the file. Period.
<LI>Fixed position: <B>First line</B> of the file if it is blank. This
  means Empty Headers.
</UL>

<P>
The Header Area is the only one that has a fixed position, line
oriented. They are located at the first three lines of the source file.
</P>
<P>
These lines are content-free, with no static information type needed.
But the following is recommended for most documents:
</P>

   <UL>
   <LI><I>line 1</I>: document title
   <LI><I>line 2</I>: author name and/or email
   <LI><I>line 3</I>: document date and/or version
                 (nice place for <CODE>%%date</CODE>)
   </UL>

<P>
Keep in mind that the first 3 lines of the source document will be the
first 3 lines on the target document, separated and with high contrast
to the text body (i.e. big letters, bold). If paging is allowed, the
headers will be alone and centralized on the first page.
</P>

<H4>Less (or None) Header lines</H4>

<P>
Sometimes the user wants to specify less than three lines for headers,
giving just the document title and/or date information.
</P>
<P>
Just let the 2nd and/or the 3rd lines empty (blank) and this position
will not be placed at the target document. But keep in mind that even
blanks, these lines are still part of the headers, so the document body
must start <B>after</B> the 3rd line anyway.
</P>
<P>
The title is the only required header (the first line), but if you
leave it blank, you are saying that your document has <B>no headers</B>.
So the <I>Body Area</I> will begin right after, on the 2nd line.
</P>
<P>
No headers on the document is often useful if you want to specify your
own customized headers after converting. The command line option
<CODE>--no-headers</CODE> is usually required for this kind of operation.
</P>

<H4>Straight to the point</H4>

<P>
In short: <B>"Headers are just <U>positions</U>, not contents"</B>
</P>
<P>
Place one text on the first line, and it will appear on the target's
first line. The same for 2nd and 3rd header lines.
</P>

<A NAME="config-area"></A>
<H2>Config Area</H2>

<P>
Location:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Begins right after the Header Area

<P>
The Config Area is optional. An average user can write lots of txt2tags
files without even know it exists, but the experienced users will
enjoy the power and control it provides.
</P>
<P>
The Config Area is used to store document-specific settings, so you don't
have to type them on the command line when converting the document. For
example, you can set the default document target type and encoding.
</P>
<P>
Please read the <A HREF="#settings-overview">Settings section</A> for more
information about them.

<P>
The body is anything outside Headers and Config Areas.
</P>
<P>
The body holds the document contents and all formatting and structures
txt2tags can recognize. Inside the body you can also put comments for
<I>TODOs</I> and self notes.
</P>
<P>
You can use the <CODE>--no-headers</CODE> command line option to convert only the
document body, suppressing the headers. This is useful to set your own
headers on a separate file, then join the converted body.

%! PostProc: '&lt;BODY.*?&gt;'  '&lt;BODY bgcolor="yellow"&gt;'
</PRE>

<A NAME="options"></A>
<H2>Command Line Options</H2>

<P>
The fastest way of changing the txt2tags default behavior is to use
command line options. This options are available on the Command Line
Interface only, not on Gui or Web.
</P>
<P>
Just like the other system's tools, the program do accept a set of
predefined options. An option is an hyphen followed by a letter or two
hyphens followed by one or more words, like <CODE>-t</CODE> and <CODE>--target</CODE>.
Talking about the target option, it is the only required one, the others
are optional.
</P>
<P>
Options that are generally used are <CODE>--outfile</CODE> to define a customized
output file name, <CODE>--toc</CODE> to turn on the automatic TOC generation and
<CODE>--encoding</CODE> to set the document character set. Most of the options
can be turned off prefixing a "no-" before its name, for example:
<CODE>--no-encoding</CODE> and <CODE>--no-toc</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
You can register the desired options for a source file inside its
Config Area, using the <CODE>%!options</CODE> setting. This way you don't have to
type them on the command line anymore.
Example: <CODE>%!options: --toc -o mydoc.html</CODE>. The exception is the target
specification, that has its own setting: <CODE>%!target: html</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Do use the <CODE>--help</CODE> option to get a complete list of all the options
available in txt2tags.
</P>

<A NAME="rc"></A>
<H2>User Configuration File (RC File)</H2>

<P>
The user configuration file (also called RC file) is a central place to
store the settings that will be shared by ALL converted files. If you
keep inserting the same settings on every .t2t file you write, move it
to the RC file and it will be used globally, for existing and future
source files.
</P>
<P>
The default location of this file depends on your system. It can also be
specified by the user, using an environment variable.
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TH COLSPAN="2">RC file location</TH>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="right">User defined</TD>
<TD><CODE>T2TCONFIG</CODE> env var</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The format of the settings is exactly the same as the ones used on the
.t2t files Config Area. There is a sample RC file on the tarball on
<CODE>doc/txt2tagsrc</CODE>. Example:
</P>

<PRE>
% my configs

%%% Always use CSS-friendly tags in HTML
%!options(html): --css-sugar

%%% Change the default TOC depth for all targets
%!options: --toc-level 4

%%% Set the default encoding for all documents
%!options: --encoding iso-8859-1
</PRE>

<P>
Any line that is not blank, a comment or a valid config line will raise
error when txt2tags runs. So be careful when editing this file.
</P>
<P>
Txt2tags automatically apply the RC file contents into any source file it
is converting. If you want to disable this behavior for a specific
file, do use the <CODE>--no-rc</CODE> command line option.
</P>

<A NAME="config-loading"></A>
<H2>Configuration Loading Order and Precedence</H2>

<P>
There are three ways of telling txt2tags which options and settings to
use, and this is the order that they are read and applied:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>The user configuration file (RC) settings
<LI>The source document Config Area settings
<LI>The command line options
</OL>

<P>
First txt2tags reads the RC file contents (if any) and apply its
configurations on the current source file. Then it scans the source
document Config Area for settings and if found, they are applied also,
overriding the RC ones in case of conflict. Finally comes the command
line options, stronger than the other two.
</P>
<P>
So, if the document encoding was defined on the three resources, the
command line will be the one used.
</P>

<A NAME="include"></A>
<H2>%!include command</H2>

<P>
The <CODE>include</CODE> command is used to paste the contents of an external
file into the source document body. It is not a config, but a command,
and it is valid on the document Body Area.
</P>
<P>
The <CODE>include</CODE> command is useful to split a large document into smaller
pieces (like chapters in a book) or to include the full contents of an
external file into the document source. Sample:
</P>

<PRE>
My first book
Dr. John Doe
1st Edition

%!include: intro.t2t
%!include: chapter1.t2t
%!include: chapter2.t2t
...
%!include: chapter9.t2t
%!include: ending.t2t
</PRE>

<P>
You just inform the filename after the <CODE>%!include</CODE> string. The
optional target specification is also supported, so this is valid
either:
</P>

<PRE>
%!include(html): file.t2t
</PRE>

<P>
Note that include will insert the file Body Area into the source
document. The included file Header and Config Areas are ignored. This
way you can convert the included file alone or inside the main document.
</P>
<P>
But there's another three types of include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Verbatim include
<LI>Raw include
<LI>Tagged include
</UL>

<P>
The <B>Verbatim</B> type includes a text file preserving its original
spaces and formatting, just like if the text was inside the txt2tags
VERB area (```). To specify this type, enclose the filename with
backquotes:
</P>

<PRE>
%!include: ``/etc/fstab``
</PRE>

<P>
The <B>Raw</B> type includes a text file as is, not trying to find and
parse txt2tags marks on it, just like if the text was inside the RAW
area ("""). To specify this type, enclose the filename with double
quotes:
</P>

<PRE>
%!include: ""nice_text.txt""
</PRE>

<P>
And the <B>Tagged</B> type is passed directly to the resulting document,
with NO parsing or escaping performed by txt2tags. This way you can
include additional tagged parts to your document. Useful for default
header or footer information, or more complicated tagged code,
unsupported by txt2tags:
</P>

<PRE>
%!include(html): ''footer.html''
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the filename is enclosed with single quotes, and as the text
inserted is already parsed, you must specify the target to avoid
mistakes.
</P>

<A NAME="includeconf"></A>
<H2>%!includeconf command</H2>

<P>
The <CODE>includeconf</CODE> command is used to include configurations from an
external file into the current one. This command is valid inside the
source document Config Area only.
</P>
<P>
It is useful to share the same config for multiple files, so you can
centralize it. On any file do you want to include that central
configuration, put a <CODE>includeconf</CODE> call. Example:
</P>

<PRE>
My First Document
John Doe
July, 2004

<H1>Part VI - Mastering Macros</H1>

<P>
Macros are special purpose keywords, that are expanded on conversion
time. They are used to insert dynamic information, for example the
current date or information about the document source.
</P>
<P>
A macro is represented by the <CODE>%%</CODE> chars followed by its name, as
<CODE>%%date</CODE>. Some macros do accept an optional formatting string inside
parenthesis, right after the macro name, such as <CODE>%%date(%Y-%m-%d)</CODE>. This
format string mixes common text with special directives, identified by a
percent sign % followed by an identification character. If not format
string is given, the default format is used.

<H2>%%mtime</H2>

<P>
The <CODE>%%mtime</CODE> macro expands to last modification time of the source
document. It is useful to register when the file was last changed.
This macro is a "sister" of the <A HREF="#macro-date">%%date macro</A>, so it
accepts exactly the same formatting directives.

links on HTML pages. Provide such link is a friendly attitude with
beginners, so they can use your source as a sample for their own page.

<A NAME="macro-toc"></A>
<H2>%%toc</H2>

<P>
The <CODE>%%toc</CODE> macro expands to the document's Table of Contents. It is
useful for you to specify exactly where you want the TOC to be placed.
You can even use the macro more than one time and place the TOC at the
end of the document also, for example. This Guide is using %%toc
to position the TOC.
</P>
<P>
Different from the other macros, this one does not accept a format
string and has its own special rules:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Valid at the document Body Area only
<LI>Must be alone on the line (leading and trailing spaces are allowed)
<LI>Must be used together with --toc command line option, or it will be
  ignored
<LI>The default automatic TOC positioning/formatting is disabled when a
  %%toc is found
</UL>

<A NAME="settings"></A>
<H1>Part VII - Mastering Settings</H1>

<P>
Settings are special configurations placed at the source document's
Config Area that can affect the conversion process. The Settings are all
optional. The average user can live fine without them. But they are
addictive, if you start using them, you'll never stop :)
</P>
<P>
Setting lines are <I>special comment lines</I>, marked by a leading
identifier ("!") that makes them different from plain comments. The
syntax is just as simple as variable setting, composed by a keyword
and a value, separated from each by a colon (":").
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TH>%! keyword : value</TH>
</TR>

<P>
Syntax details:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The exclamation mark must be placed together with the comment char
  ("%!"), no spaces between them.
<P></P>
<LI>The spaces around the keyword and the separator are optional.
<P></P>
<LI>Both keyword and value are case insensitive (case doesn't matter).
</UL>

<P>
Rules:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Settings are valid only inside the Config Area, and are considered
  plain comments if found on the document Body.
<P></P>
<LI>If the same keyword appears more than one time on the Config Area, the
  last found will be the one used. Exception: options, preproc and
  postproc, which are cumulative.
<P></P>
<LI>A setting line with an invalid keyword will be considered a plain
  comment line.
<P></P>
<LI>This settings have precedence over RC file, but not on command line
  options.
</UL>

<A NAME="setting-target"></A>
<H2>%!Target</H2>

<P>
Using the target setting, a default target format is defined for the
document:
</P>

<PRE>
%!target: html
</PRE>

<P>
This way the user can just call
</P>

<PRE>
$ txt2tags file.t2t
</PRE>

<P>
And the conversion will be done, to the specified target.
</P>
<P>
The target setting does not support optional target specification.
That doesn't make sense, such as <CODE>%!target(tex): html</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="setting-options"></A>
<H2>%!Options</H2>

<P>
Writing long command lines every time you need to convert a document
is boring and error prone. The Options setting let the user save
all the converting options together with the source document. This also
ensures that the document will always be converted the same way, with
the same options.
</P>
<P>
Just write it with no syntax errors, as you were on the real command
line. But omit the "txt2tags" program call on the beginning, the target
specification and the source filename from the ending.
</P>
<P>
For example, if you do use this command line to convert your document:
</P>

<PRE>
$ txt2tags -t html --toc --toc-level 2 --enum-title file.t2t
</PRE>

<P>
You can save yourself from typing pain using this Options setting inside
the document source:
</P>

<PRE>
%!target: html
%!options(html): --toc --toc-level 2 --enum-title
</PRE>

<P>
As the real command line is now just "<CODE>txt2tags file.t2t</CODE>", you can run
the conversion right inside your favorite text editor, while editing the
document source. In Vi, this is:
</P>

<PRE>
:!txt2tags %
</PRE>

<A NAME="setting-encoding"></A>
<H2>%!Encoding</H2>

<P>
The Encoding setting is needed by non-english writers, who uses
accented letters and other locale specific details, so the target
document <I>Character Set</I> must be customized (if allowed).
</P>
<P>
The valid values for the Encoding setting are the same charset names
valid for HTML documents, like <I>iso-8859-1</I> and <I>koi8-r</I>. If
you're not sure which encoding you should use,
<A HREF="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">this complete (and long!) list</A>
should help.
</P>
<P>
The LateX target use alias names for encoding. This is not a problem
for the user, because txt2tags translate the names internally. Some
examples:
</P>

</TABLE>

<P>
If the value is unknown to txt2tags, it will be passed "as is",
allowing user to specify custom encodings.
</P>

<A NAME="setting-preproc"></A>
<H2>%!PreProc</H2>

<P>
The PreProc is an input filter used on the Body Area of the source document. It is a "find
and replace" feature, applied right after the line is read from the
document source, before any parsing by txt2tags.
</P>
<P>
It is useful to define some abbreviations for common typed text, as:
</P>

<PRE>
%!preproc JJS          "John J. Smith"
%!preproc RELEASE_DATE "2003-05-01"
%!preproc BULLET       "[images/tiny/bullet_blue.png]"
</PRE>

<P>
So the user can write a line like:
</P>

<PRE>
Hi, I'm JJS. Today is RELEASE_DATE.
</PRE>

<P>
And txt2tags will "see" this line as:
</P>

<PRE>
Hi, I'm John J. Smith. Today is 2003-05-01.
</PRE>

<P>
This filter is a component that acts between the document author
and the txt2tags conversion. It's like a first conversion before the
"real" one. Its behavior is similar to an external Sed/Perl filter,
called this way:
</P>

<PRE>
$ cat file.t2t | preproc-script.sh | txt2tags -
</PRE>

<P>
So the txt2tags parsing will begin after all the PreProc substitutions
were applied.
</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note:</B> Remember that the preprocessing is applied only to the BODY of the source document, not including the Header Area and Config Area.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="setting-postproc"></A>
<H2>%!PostProc</H2>

<P>
The PostProc is an output filter used on the converted document. It is a
"find and replace" feature, applied after all txt2tags parsing and
processing is done.
</P>
<P>
It is useful to do some refinements on the generated document, change
tags and add extra text or tags. Quick samples:
</P>

<PRE>
%!postproc(html): '&lt;BODY.*?&gt;' '&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="green"&gt;'
%!postproc(tex) : "\\newpage" ""
</PRE>

<P>
These filters change the background color of the HTML page and remove
the page breaks on the LaTeX target.
</P>
<P>
The PostProc rules are just like an external Sed/Perl filter, called
this way:
</P>

<PRE>
$ txt2tags -t html -o- file.t2t | postproc-script.sh &gt; file.html
</PRE>

<P>
Before this feature was introduced, it was very common to have little
scripts to "adjust" the txt2tags results. These scripts were in fact
just lots of sed (or alike) commands, to do "substitute this for that"
actions. Now this replacement strings can be saved together with the
document text, and the plus is to use the Python powerful Regular
Expression machine to find patterns.
</P>

<A NAME="setting-style"></A>
<H2>%!Style</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Useful in HTML and XHTML targets, it defines a CSS file for the target
  document.
<P></P>
<LI>Useful in LaTeX target, to load <CODE>\usepackage</CODE> modules.
<P></P>
<LI>The same effect is achieved with the command line option <CODE>--style</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI>The --style option is stronger than %!style. If both are used, --style
  wins.
</UL>

<A NAME="setting-specific"></A>
<H2>Defining a Setting for a Specific Target</H2>

<P>
All the settings (except %!target) can be glued with a specific target
using the <CODE>%!key(target): value</CODE> syntax. This way user can define
different config for different targets.
</P>
<P>
This is specially useful in the pre/postproc filters, but is applicable
to all settings. For example, defining different styles for HTML and
LaTeX:
</P>

<PRE>
%!style(html): fancy.css
%!style(tex) : amssymb
</PRE>

<P>
For the options setting it's very useful to adjust the converted
document:
</P>

<PRE>
%!target: sgml
%!options(sgml): --toc
%!options(html): --style foo.css
%!options(txt ): --toc-only --toc-level 2
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the default target is Sgml and it will use TOC. If the
user run <CODE>txt2tags -t html file.t2t</CODE>, only the HTML options will be
used, so the converted file will use "foo.css" style file and will
have no TOC.
</P>

<A NAME="filters-details"></A>
<H2>Details for PreProc and PostProc Filters</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Filters are a "find and replace" feature (think SED)
<P></P>
<LI>Filters do not follow the "last found, one used" schema, they're
  cumulative. You can define as many filters as needed, with no limit.
  They will be applied on the same order as defined.
<P></P>
<LI>Different from other settings, both the target specific filters and
  the generic ones (all targets) are used. On the following example,
  both filters are used on the HTML target:
<PRE>
%!postproc      :   this   that
%!postproc(html):   that   other
</PRE>

<P></P>
<LI>The filters must receive exactly TWO arguments
<P></P>
<LI>Special escapes as <CODE>\n</CODE> (line break) and <CODE>\t</CODE> (tabulation) are
  interpreted
<P></P>
<LI>To delete some text, change it by an empty string
<PRE>
%!postproc: "undesired string" ""
</PRE>

<P></P>
<LI>To avoid problems, always use the explicit target form when using
  PostProc to change tags: <CODE>%!PostProc(target): &lt;this&gt; &lt;that&gt;</CODE>
<P></P>
<LI>PREproc is applied right after the line is read, and POSTproc is
  applied after all the parsing was made. They are exactly the same as
  (UUOC ahead):
<PRE>
$ cat file.t2t | preproc.sh | txt2tags | postproc.sh
</PRE>

<P></P>
<LI>The first part of a filter (the "search for" part) is not read as a
  regular string, but a Regular Expression pattern. If you don't know
  what these expressions do, don't worry, you may never have to. Just
  keep in mind that you will need to "escape" some characters to use
  them. To escape is to prefix the character with a backslash "\". Here
  is the list:
<PRE>
\*  \+  \.  \^  \$  \?  \(  \)  \{  \[  \|  \\
</PRE>

<P></P>
<LI>Python Regular Expressions are available! They're similar to Perl
  Regexes (PCRE). Example: Change all opening and closing "B" tags to
  "STRONG" on HTML:
<PRE>
%!postproc(html):   '(&lt;/?)B&gt;'   '\1STRONG&gt;'
</PRE>

<P></P>
<LI>The filter arguments can be passed on 3 ways:
    <OL>
    <LI>A single unquoted word such as FOO (no spaces)
    <LI>A string double quoted such as "FOO"
    <LI>A string single quoted such as 'FOO'
    <P></P>
    </OL>
<LI>If your pattern has double quotes, protect it with single quotes and
  vice-versa. Some valid samples:
<PRE>
%!postproc:   PATT    REPLACEMENT
%!postproc:  "PATT"  "REPLACEMENT"
%!postproc:  'PATT'  'REPLACEMENT'
%!postproc:   PATT   "REPLACEMENT"
%!postproc:  "PATT"  'REPLACEMENT'
</PRE>

<H1>Part VIII - Black Magic</H1>

<P>
This chapter is really not recommended for newbies. It demonstrates how
to do strange things with txt2tags filters, abusing of complex
patterns and Regular Expressions.
</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>BEWARE!</B> The following procedures are NOT encouraged and can
	break things. Even some text from the document source can be
	lost on the conversion process, not appearing on the target
	document. Just use these tactics if you really need them and
	know what you are doing.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note:</B> Filters are a powerful feature, but can be dangerous!
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note:</B> Bad filters do generate unexpected results.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Keep that in mind, please.
</P>

<A NAME="postproc-multiline"></A>
<H2>Inserting Multiple Lines with %!PostProc (like CSS rules)</H2>

<P>
In filters, the replacement pattern can include multiple lines using the
<CODE>\n</CODE> line break char.
</P>
<P>
This can be handy for including really short CSS rules on HTML target,
with no need to create a separate file:
</P>

<PRE>
%!postproc: &lt;HEAD&gt;      '&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;STYLE TYPE="text/css"&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;'
%!postproc: (&lt;/STYLE&gt;)  'body     { margin:3em               ;} \n\1'
%!postproc: (&lt;/STYLE&gt;)  'a        { text-decoration:none     ;} \n\1'
%!postproc: (&lt;/STYLE&gt;)  'pre,code { background-color:#ffffcc ;} \n\1'
%!postproc: (&lt;/STYLE&gt;)  'th       { background-color:yellow  ;} \n\1'
</PRE>

<P>
All the filters are tied to the first one, by replacing a string that it
has inserted. So a single "&lt;HEAD&gt;" turns to:
</P>

<PRE>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;STYLE TYPE="text/css"&gt;
body     { margin:3em               ;}
a        { text-decoration:none     ;}
pre,code { background-color:#ffffcc ;}
th       { background-color:yellow  ;}
&lt;/STYLE&gt;
</PRE>

<A NAME="target-specific-contents"></A>
<H2>Creating "Target-Specific" Contents with %!PreProc</H2>

<P>
Sometimes you need to insert some text on a specific target, but not on
the others. This kind of strange behavior can be done using some
PreProc tricks.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to insert this extra text on the document source as
comments, but mark it in a way that a target-specific filter will
"uncomment" those lines.
</P>
<P>
For example, if an extra paragraph must be added only in HTML target.
Place the text as special comments, like this:
</P>

<PRE>
%html% This HTML page is Powered by [txt2tags http://txt2tags.sf.net].
%html% See the source TXT file [here source.t2t].
</PRE>

<P>
As those lines start with <CODE>%</CODE>, they are plain comments lines and will be
ignored. But when adding this special filter:
</P>

<PRE>
%preproc(html): '^%html% ' ''
</PRE>

<P>
The leading string is removed and those lines will be "activated", not
being comments anymore. As a explicit target config, this filter will be
processed for HTML targets only.
</P>

<A NAME="creating-marks"></A>
<H2>Changing Txt2tags Marks with %!PreProc</H2>

<P>
Being a Regular Expressions guru, the user can customize the document
source syntax, changing the txt2tags default marks to some he find more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
For example, a leading TAB is the Quotation mark. If the user doesn't
like it, or his text editor has some strange relationship with TABs, he
can define a new mark for Quoted text. Say a leading "&gt;&gt;&gt; " was his
choice. Then he will do this simple filter:
</P>

<PRE>
%!PreProc: '&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '\t'
</PRE>

<P>
And on the document source, the quoted text will be something like:
</P>

<PRE>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a quoted text.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The user defined this strange mark.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But they will be converted to TABs by PreProc.
</PRE>

<P>
Before the parsing begins, the strange "&gt;&gt;&gt; " will be converted to
TABs and txt2tags will recognize the Quote mark.
</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>BEWARE!</B> Extreme PreProc rules could eventually
	change the entire marks syntax, even generating conflicts
	between marks. Be really really careful when doing this.

<H1>Part IX - Txt2tags HISTORY</H1>

<P>
On July 2001, it was launched the first public release of txt2tags,
version 0.1. But its origins date more than a year before that...
</P>
<P>
This chapter gives an overview about the tool development since its very
first draw until the current series.
</P>

<A NAME="history-1999-1"></A>
<H2>1999 January: Pre-History</H2>

<DL>
<DT>From the author:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"My really first attempts of a text conversion tool began back
in 1999, as a very simple and limited Bourne Shell script that
converts marked text to an HTML page. Yes, Yet-Another txt2html
tool. Everyone, everywhere must have done one of this already...
In short, it just recognized simple marks such as <CODE>*bold*</CODE>,
<CODE>/italic/</CODE>, <CODE>_under_</CODE>, and escape the classic <CODE>&lt; &amp; &gt;</CODE> HTML
special characters. Not impressive, but hey! I was young ;)"
</DL>

<A NAME="history-1999-2"></A>
<H2>1999 June: Still Pre-History</H2>

<DL>
<DT>The author wants to speak some more:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"Some months passed, and a big Sgml hype arrived at the company
I was working (Conectiva). So the txt2html turned into a
txt2sgml script. I was really trying to learn about SED* at
that moment so txt2sgml was a 110 lines Bourne Shell script
with lots of SED code."
</DL>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note:</B> SED is the UNIX Stream EDitor, an automatic text
	editing tool.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This improved Sgml version has more supported structures as lists
and verbatim text. On the following sample file, you can see
the txt2tags marks origins:
</P>

<PRE>
* This was a bold line (BOLD line oriented? Well...)

  --
- bullet list was very similar to txt2tags list
- but with these -- to begin and close a list
  --

=----------------------
Verbatim text was delimited by the =-- pattern.
The other ------- were just cosmetic.
=----------------------
</PRE>

<P>
Still not impressive, but the big step is coming...
</P>

<A NAME="history-2000"></A>
<H2>2000 August: Not Pre-History Anymore</H2>

<DL>
<DT>The author once again:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"A year passed and at that time I was really in love with
SED. The txt2sgml.sh shell script was rewritten and became
a 350 lines pure SED script. Some exciting features were
added such as subsections, URL recognition and sublists. I have
used and improved this script a lot, for almost a year."
</DL>

<P>
A txt2sgml.sed sample file:
</P>

<PRE>
* Hey, here are the first 3 magic lines
* The document title / author / date
* But they required those asterisks at the beginning

MAIN TITLE

Titles were made by uppercase-only lines. Subtitles were identified by
leading spaces. Each space denoted a new sublevel. The beautifiers:
*bold*, **strong**, "italic" and `typewriter`.

- lists
  + sublists
    = and subsublists (by identifier, not indentation)


Two blank lines to close lists. Links as www.example.com and e-mails
were recognized automagically by regular expressions. And there was a
strange image mark:
%%image: path/to/image.jpg

<H2>2001 May: Pythonization and Multi-target Idea</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Guess who will speak:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"I've started to write my <A HREF="http://guia-er.sf.net">Regular Expression book</A>
and used the txt2sgml.sed marked text format. This way I could convert
it to sgml (then to HTML using sgml2html tool) and quickly check on
the browser how the book was going. As 'quick' and 'sgml2html' don't
match, I've modified the SED script to a txt2html.sed tool, generating
HTML directly. [...] The publisher used Adobe PageMaker software to
format books and it was a problem for a Linux guy like me. But I was
happy to know that PageMaker had a tagged HTML-like language, so I've
started to turn my script into a txt2pagemaker.sed tool. I've ended up
with three similar SED scripts, converting my texts to sgml, HTML and
PageMaker. And some other Shell scripts were made to extract the book
TOC (Table Of Contents) and do post formatting. At the middle of the
book writing, I had the idea to join it all in a single tool, and
choose Python as the language. TXT2TAGS was born."
</DL>

<A NAME="history-2001-2"></A>
<H2>2001 July: 0.x series: Debut of txt2tags (World Release)</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Yes, him:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"The release of the printed book (July, 31) and the
release of the very first txt2tags 0.1 version (July, 26)
were very close, a matter of days. One depended on the other,
they were developed together. Besides sgml, HTML and
PageMaker, other targets were implemented for this release:
MoinMoin, MagicPoint and plain text. For more than a year,
more releases of the 0.x series were made and the program
began to grow: new target UNIX Man Page, %%date macro,
table support, Web interface, smart image alignment and
Table Of Contents generation.
On version 0.2 a Shell script wrapper was added to handle
file operation and command line options. I've made it
because I was a shell wizard and a Python newbie. Only
in version 0.9 txt2tags came back to a 100% Python code."
</DL>

<H2>2002 September: 1.x series: Growing</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Won't you release the microphone?</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"The txt2tags idea has proved to be good. I've decided to
get serious on it. The next step was to spread the program
out, to tell the world about it: documentation! The program
site was launched, mailing lists (english and portuguese)
were configured and the User Guide has born.
The user base grew and many contributions came. Yes, I
thought, it is working. The new features added on the 1.x
series include: Graphical interface (GUI), Windows &amp; Mac
compatibility, LaTeX target, %!style, include command and
the powerful Pre and Post processing filters."

<H2>2004 July: 2.x series: Maturing</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Ok, talk, I give up:</DT><DD>
<P></P>
"Growing is hard and strange. Remember I said I was a Python
newbie? Now I got better, but the old mistakes accumulated,
and a major code rewrite was unavoidable. This broke backwards
compatibility with some marks, and an upgrade script was
created. It took a long time, but version 2.0 was released.
It came with tons of news such as XHTML target, W3C validated
code, i18n, and RC file. A team of translators has came and
the program and its documentation were translated to many
languages. The Lout target was added, and new macros:
%%mtime, %%infile, %%outfile, and %%toc.
Continues..."
