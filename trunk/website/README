txt2tags website README
=======================

Here you will find the files for the full txt2tags website.

After editing a source .t2t file, remember to convert it.
A single "txt2tags file.t2t" is enough, since all the conversion
options are inside the file itself.

IMPORTANT: Please preview the results in your browser before
           committing the changes to the SVN.

After the commit, your changes will take some time to appear at
the txt2tags website. A cronjob at the web server will do a
"svn update" once a day at noon. You don't need to worry about it.

Some files seems to be missing. But they're not! They're included
directly from the SVN. See .htaccess for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Linking SVN files
=================

There's a copy of trunk/doc/ inside the web server root, so just use:

http://txt2tags.org/doc/

as the base URL to link any document inside it. HTML documents will be
rendered and UTF-8 is the default encoding, so you won't have any
problem showing a document. For example, to link the French man page:

http://txt2tags.org/doc/French/manpage-fr.html

To show files that are not inside the /trunk/doc/ folder, use the
Google Code direct link. The trunk root URL is:

http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

So, for example, to make a link to the Creole sample:

http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/sample.creole

There's two caveats:

1. HTML files won't be rendered, their sources will be shown:

   http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/sample.html

2. Google Code does not serve documents as UTF-8 :(

   http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/po/fr.po

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Docs path
=========

The 'doc' folder is special for the website. It's location changes in
the web server, to be contained inside the root folder.

SVN structure:
    trunk/doc/
    trunk/website/
    trunk/website/index.html

Web server structure:
    /index.html
    /doc/

So keep that in mind when writing or editing pages.

If you need to include the contents of a document inside a page,
use the '../doc/' path. If you are making a link to a document, use
the 'doc/' path. Example:

    %!include: ../doc/English/markup/markup.t2t

    See the [Markup Demo doc/English/markup/markup.html] document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

.htaccess
=========

The magic of using other SVN files in the website happens here.
Redirection of moved and deleted files too.

If you don't know what htaccess is, please DO NOT edit it.
You may break the full website doing so.

If you're comfortable with htaccess, the comments inside the file
should be enough to guide you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Convert full site
=================

If you alter files inside the 'inc' folder, such as config.t2t or
footer.t2t, you will need to reconvert all the files.

    cd txt2tags-svn/website/
    ../extras/html-update.sh -f -c
    txt2tags sample-full.t2t

Note: An error will appear when converting index-old.t2t.
      That's ok, this file isn't meant to be converted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update docs
===========

The docs and their translations are read directly from SVN. A cronjob
at the web server will keep them updated. You don't need to worry
about it.

The only exceptions, that need to be converted manually are:

trunk/website/sample-full.t2t
trunk/website/manpage.t2t
trunk/website/markup.t2t

Because they add the website layout around the SVN document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Special updates
===============

Update txt2tags online (PHP version)

    The only difference from SVN is the $is_standalone = 0. Run this:

    cd txt2tags-svn/website/
    sed '/^\$is_standalone = 1;$/ s/1/0/' ../extras/txt2tags.php > online.phps


Update executable version (http://txt2tags.org/txt2tags.py)

    It must always point to the current stable release.
    Edit .htaccess and search for these lines:

    Redirect temp /txt2tags     http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/old/txt2tags-2.6.py
    Redirect temp /txt2tags.py  http://txt2tags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/old/txt2tags-2.6.py


Update markup.zip

    cd txt2tags-svn/website/
    rm -f markup.zip
    cd ../doc/English && zip -q -r $OLDPWD/markup.zip markup -x "markup/.svn/*" && cd -
    unzip -l markup.zip


Update User Guide

    ./txt2tags-svn/doc/English/userguide/htmlgen

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Legacy files
============

index-old.html
index-old.t2t
misc/history.html
misc/history.t2t
misc/oldnews.html
misc/oldnews.t2t
misc/pt-comentarios.html
misc/pt-comentarios.t2t
misc/pt-enquete.html

These are old files that are kept for history purposes.

DO NOT convert index-old.t2t. Leave it untouched.
