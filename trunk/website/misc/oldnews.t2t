: //26 Jul 2006// Blog? Blog.

Hi there.

There is a new place to stay in touch with the latest news about the
project: [the txt2tags Blog {URLBLOG}]. Stay updated about releases,
files, documents, translations, site updates.

The good old do-it-yourself news/RSS by hand worked until today, but
using a Blog system like WordPress, we get some advantages:

 - Feeds (RSS) with HTML code. The old "by hand" was text-only.
 - Automatic feeds for: whole blog, each category, each post, all
   comments, comments by post.
 - Permanent (readable) URL for each post, important to keep things
   organized and easy to find.
 - Multiple categories (tags) to mark each post, so you can monitor
   just want interests you.
 - And more.
 -

Talking about feeds, subscribe to the txt2tags blog now!

But my favorite feature is having **comments for each post**. Now
everybody can talk and contribute, changing the monologue to a nice
conversation.

It's up and running. Enjoy!

: //11 Jul 2006// NetBSD txt2tags package

__Daniel Bolgheroni__ packaged txt2tags for the NetBSD system
(pkgsrc). Got interested? Check the [download page SITEROOT/download.html].

: //06 Feb 2006// New Apache module mod_t2t

__Cesar Gimenes__ created a new module for the Apache web server,
[mod_t2t http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-t2t/]. Using this module
you can upload just the .t2t files to the web server, and the HTML
files will be generated on demand. It saves disk space since the
source files are smaller, and maybe some interesting uses of the
""%%date"" macro may appear!

: //12 Aug 2005// Txt2tags project and donations

  After 4 years of txt2tags, donations are now turned ON. SourceForge
  has a nice built-in donate feature (via PayPal), so I thought "Why
  not?". If you like to donate to Open Source software,
  [now you can {URLDONATE}]. If you don't, just ignore the Donate
  button.

  **FAQ:** Nothing changes. Txt2tags will never be paid-software.
  I don't expect to become rich. The site won't be spammed with Donate
  buttons. Txt2tags continues to be a one-man spare-time project, with
  the help of [many volunteers SITEROOT/team/].

: //05 Aug 2005// The Txt2tags Team Gallery

  As you may have noticed by the latest news, the translators are
  working very hard, even fighting the big 50-page User Guide. Doing so,
  they have their nice happy picture placed on the brand-new
  [Txt2tags Team Gallery SITEROOT/team/]. Don't miss this link, see them all! But
  I'm wondering... Why they keep translating even when their picture is
  already there? Maybe they are trying to impress Fabianne, the only
  girl on the team? ;)

  Inspired by the previous book announce, there is a new
  [Writing Books with Txt2tags {DOCBOOK}] document, showing the

Release time, version 1.7 is out!

The users most requested command was added: %!include. Now you can
insert text, parsed tags or even another .t2t file into the document
source. See the User Guide related topic for details.

More checkins were added and some bugs fixed. Emacs users will like
the brand new rewritten syntax highlight file! Vim users can also
count with the up-to-date syntax file.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** This release closes my 1.x series, no 1.8 or 1.9
versions will come out. The next one will be the so waited 2.0, with
rewritten Python code, more polished conversions and the new target
XHTML. I will be cooler!

: //23 Aug 2003// Created that strange bright red octopus

  I'm not an octopus, I'm a robot. I don't know why my master did that
  strange image and put it here... But it's kinda cool :)

: //22 Aug 2003// Portuguese translation of the website and documentation

  The new Portuguese mailing list joined together the Brazilian
  txt2tags users and lots of program documentation was translated.
  The new portuguese site is a portal to all these documents.

: //23 Jul 2003// Released my new version 1.6

Hi there! Here I am again with fresh news.

Today my v1.6 was released. The main improvements are the new
 %!preproc: and %!postproc: user defined filters. They are used to
do some strange things on documents (see User Guide). There's also a
new mark + for explicit numbered titles, //+like this+//, so now you
can mix normal titles with numbered ones, like a book with Appendix.

Now all the config settings can be linked with a specific target,
using the new //%!key(target): value// syntax. The target specification
is optional, so the parenthesis and its contents can be omitted. A nice
sample: //%!encoding(html): iso-8859-1//

Lots of user reported bugs were fixed, titles on LaTeX are unnumbered
by default (as other targets) and the Gui was improved, showing
 %!cmdline contents (if any) and refreshing checkboxes when a new
file is loaded. Gui also can receive options from the command line, as
in //txt2tags --gui -n file.t2t//

: //21 Jul 2003// My site is now using some CSS

  I'm feeling weird...

: //18 Jul 2003// New portuguese Mailing List

  My user base is growing a lot! Specially by Brazilians, nice people
  of my master's land. So there's a brand new
  [Mailing List {URLMAILINGPT}] for you Portuguese speakers! And prepare
  yourself for more surprises, as sample files and documentation also in
  portuguese. Just don't hold your breath ;)

: //12 Jul 2003// New txt2tags for Windows project

  I have a brother! Mr. __Guaracy Monteiro__ from Brazil created a new
  project called [txt2tags-win {URLWIN}], which purpose is to provide
  handy .EXE files for Windows users use me. If you do use Windows (with
  Python installed or not), check out the nice distribution files from
  his site!

: //15 May 2003// New txt2tags.EXE install file for Windows

  Please go to the txt2tags-win page: {URLWIN}

: //14 May 2003// GUI patch for version 1.5 (turns to v1.5.1)

  I'm sad :( My master released me with a critical bug on my Graphical
  Interface. Command line & Web users has no reason to worry.

  If you do use me on the GUI mode (the orange one),
  please apply the patch to fix me.


: //09 May 2003// Released my new version 1.5

Tsc, Tsc... Almost three months from the last version, what a shame!
But the new features will worth the delay.

The most important improvement is my new %!cmdline setting. Using
it you can define default options for each document, and when
converting, you can call me with no options at all! Example: You place
a "//%!cmdline: -t html --toc//" line on your source document, then you
can convert it with the simple "//txt2tags file.t2t//" command.

There is also a new --outfile option (-o for short) to set the
output filename. If you specify "//-o -//", you get the same behavior
of the old --stdout option (which is now deprecated).

Talking about options, there are the new short -H and -n for the
existing --noheaders and --enumtitle options. A nice quick
example:

```
txt2tags-v1.4 -t html --enumtitle --stdout file.t2t > new.html
txt2tags-v1.5 -t html -n -o new.html file.t2t
```

Ah! LaTeX target now supports images :)

: //18 February 2003// Released my new version 1.4

I've enjoyed my X-mas/New Year vacation, then some lazy days on
a hot Brazilian beach, what a great time! But now it is time to get
back to work, so there's a new release of the most sexy text eater
out there: **me!**

The burning sun has made lots of changes on me. I'm specially proud
of my new ability to master table alignment. I can place the table
centered or not, and I can place //each table cell// contents wherever
I want! Left, Right, Centered... See AbuseMe! file for a
demonstration.

The good news for HTML users is that now I've learned about that
Cascading thing... SCC, CCS, CSS, I don't remember... Just use my
new --style command line option or the %!Style: setting.

There's a new --toclevel option also, and I promise I'll not make
TOC deeper than the number you pass me.

Mmmmmm, there were some bug fixes also, but let's forget about them,
you know I'm not buggy! ;)

: //01 January 2003// I was forked! Oops, ported!

  Hey! I was "ported" (or something like that) to a system called
  FreeBSD. Mmmmm, they have a demon... But I don't wanna go to hell!!!

: //20 December 2002// Released my new version 1.3

Weeee, I'm tired! Lots of changes were made on me for this release and
now I need a break!

The news include a brand new mark (rare to happen!) for raw text, this
way you can easily include marks on the document target and I promise
I won't parse them!

A new //Encoding// command is available also for worldwide users
specify their own Character Set for their documents.

And there are more improvements and fixes, but please read the
ChangeLog file because now I'll go to sleep. zzZZzzzzZZZZzz...

: //20 December 2002// My new User Guide

  My dear master released a new document, and it talks about me!
  This doc is still on the larval stage, but it will be cool someday.
  [Read all about me {DOCUSERGUIDE}], contribute, fix typos, enjoy!

: //03 December 2002// Released my new version 1.2 (LaTeX release)

Hi! Finally I've learned one of the geek's most used document
formatting: **LaTeX**. Just run me with "//-t tex//" and see your
current .t2t files turn into LaTeX, ready for compiling!

Ah! I'm getting smart, and now I can handle more than one file at the
same time. Hint: *.t2t

And my last new feature is the ability of strip down an HTML file to
an "almost finished" .t2t file. Sorry !Vimmers, because this works on
Vim only.

What are you waiting for? Download me right now and test my new
features: //txt2tags --toc -t tex *.t2t//

: //06 November 2002// Released my new version 1.1

Attention! Please read //carefully// before upgrade me!

This new v1.1 is a **compatibility break** release.

This means that after upgrading, you will have to check your current
txt2tags files, and possibly fix them. Ignoring this release is not an
option :) because the next versions will assume you have fixed your
files.

Please read the "Survivor's Guide for v1.1 Upgrade" for more detailed
information about what has changed and how to fix your files.

But there are nice news also:
 - Images can now point to links, as: ""[[img.gif] www.abc.com]""
 - New foldmethod=syntax rules on the Vim syntax file
 - Improvements on the URL matcher
 -

: //23 October, 2002// My own mailing list

  Today I woke up from bed surprised with a brand new
  [mailing list {URLMAILING}] about me! Please subscribe, please,
  pleeeeeeease ;)

: //01 October, 2002// My new web page

  Today my dear master gave me a new site. Now I'm sexy!

: //25 September, 2002// Released my new version 1.0

This release starts my //1.x series//.

More than a year of almost-monthly updates, and the //0.x series//
provided me a nice set of features, as Command Line and Web interface,
TOC handling, numbering titles and lists, STDIN/STDOUT facilities,
vim/emacs syntax files and seven supported target formats.

For the incoming //1.x series//, I'll try to spread myself out,
providing a nice GUI, extensive documentation, mailing list, user
base, Unix/Windows/Mac full compatibility and including more targets
(as tex, rtf and xhtml).

On this 1.0 release I'm already at full speed ahead, with a new suit
(Graphical Tk Interface) and compatibility with Unix/Windows/Mac,
handling line breaks and other platform specific issues. Fortunately,
now my master can reach Linux, Windows 2000, Cygwin and MacOS 8.6
systems for testing me.
