% txt2tags sample config file
%
% This is a sample for the .txt2tagsrc user config file.
% Part of the txt2tags project (http://txt2tags.org).
%
% Copy this file to $HOME/.txt2tagsrc (or %homepath%/_t2trc
% on Windows) and edit it to fit your needs. All configs are
% COMMENTED, just remove the leading % for the ones you want
% to use.
%
% The config syntax is:
%
%            %!keyword  (target)  :  value
%
% Keywords:
%    target, options, style, preproc, postproc
% Targets:
%    The valid txt2tags targets (i.e.: html, man, tex)
%
% Details:
% - If the '(target)' part is omitted, the config is valid for
%   all targets
% - The %!keyword must be at the line start, no leading spaces
% - All the options defined here can be overwritten by command
%   line options and document config
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% Set a default target if none specified
%   Useful if you always use the same target for all documents
%%!target: html

% Set the TOC depth for all targets
%   Valid values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
%   The default is 3
%%!options: --toc-level 2

% Always mask e-mails from robots in HTML and MOIN documents
%   Example: john@company.com turns to <john (a) company com>
%   This can be turned off later with --no-mask-email
%%!options(html): --mask-email
%%!options(moin): --mask-email

% Always enumerate all title lines for text output
%   This can be turned off later with --no-enum-title
%%!options(txt): --enum-title

% Always make TOC (Table of Contents) in LaTeX documents
%   This can be turned off later with --no-toc
%%!options(tex): --toc

%   The order is: bg1, fg1, bg2, fg2
%%!guicolors: blue white brown yellow

%%% FILTERS
%
% PreProc and PostProc filters are powerful tools to customize
% txt2tags behavior and perform nice tricks. But be careful,
% they do use Regular Expressions and can be dangerous if bad
% written. Really test them before including here.

% Shorthand for the javascript BACK call in HTML
%   Contribution from Prof. Sergio de Albuquerque Souza
%   Example: [Click here JAVABACK] to go back.
%%!postproc(html):   JAVABACK   javascript:history.back()

% Trick to create super/subscript text in HTML
%   Example: I will use ^^superscript^^ and also ,,subscript,,
%%!postproc(html): '\^\^(.*?)\^\^'  '<span style="vertical-align:super">\1</span>'
%%!postproc(html): ',,(.*?),,'  '<span style="vertical-align:sub">\1</span>'

% LaTeX and TeX names appearing on their classical formats
%%!postproc(tex):   LaTeX   \\LaTeX{}
%%!postproc(tex):   \bTeX   \\TeX{}
