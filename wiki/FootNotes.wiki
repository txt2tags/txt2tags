Put in txt2tagsrc these lines:

{{{
%%%% For Footnotes in Lout
%!postproc(lout): \(\( @FootNote {
%!postproc(lout): \)\) }
%%%% For manage Footnotes in HTML
%!postproc(html): \(\( <small>(
%!postproc(html): \)\) )</small>
}}}

I write the Footnote into the text as ((This is a note)) then with the command
 {{{
txt2tags -t lout nameFile.t2t
}}}
and
{{{
lout -Z nameFile.lout > nemaFile.pdf
}}}
I have a pdf with Footnotes.

And with
{{{
txt2tags -t html nameFile.t2t
}}}
a HTML file with (notes) in small characters.
