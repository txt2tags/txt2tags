#summary Ideas for the new version 3.0!

=txt2tags v3=

*Time to rethink everything*



The recent updates in the txt2tags development code (r41, r42, r44, r47, r52) has changed the resulting tagged code. These changes were necessary to make a saner line break behavior across targets. It may break some current postproc filters that used to rely on the old format.

Since the compatibility break is unavoidable (and necessary for evolution), now we have the rare opportunity to rethink everything and change things further, making an even bigger step towards quality.

The last jump has in 2004, when version 2.0 came out with [http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/v2-news.html many many improvements and new features].

This time we'll jump from 2.5 to 3.0 and lots of cool ideas are waiting to be matured and implemented.

Please read this *list of ideas* and leave a comment, telling your preferences. New ideas are also very welcome!

= Proposed New Features =

 # Tagged mark, with optional target specification: {{{'''html}}}
 # New mark for footnotes
 # Extended table syntax, allowing rowspan and blocks (such as lists) inside cells
 # Improve the resulting code legibility, adding line breaks and spacing (breaks compatibility)
 # Multiple target on the -t option: {{{txt2tags -t txt,html,tex input.t2t}}}
 # Multiple target on the settings: {{{%!options(html,xhtml,sgml): --toc}}}
 # New option {{{--split}}} to generate multiple pages from a single source
 # New option {{{--dump-tree}}} (or something) to show the document structure (outline)
 # Make UTF-8 the default encoding for the generated documents (if needed to specify one)
 # Make the internal string handling 100% UTF-8 on the txt2tags code
 # Use {{{.html}}} as the default XHTML file extension
 # Distribution: change the {{{tar.gz}}} format to {{{zip}}}
 # Some kind of plugin interface
 # Improve the module interface
 # Improve the PHP interface with Javascript and buttons for formatting (bold, quote, etc)
 # New Mac interface
 # Code compatible with Python3
 # New {{{%!exec}}} command to execute external commands and insert the results on the document: {{{%!exec: cat -n myapp.py}}} (security implications)
 # {{{$HOME/txt2tags}}} folder to store things: file history, command history, style files, includes, config, run count, allowed files for %!exec, alternative header templates, --split templates, plugins

= New Name? =

Maybe it's a good opportunity to improve the program name?

txt2tags is hard to pronounce and it is common to see it referred as text2tags.

A new, simple name, could help the project to spread. [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ Markdown] is a killer name, maybe we could find something as strong and simple?

= Proposed New HTML Features =

Style:

 # DIVs are added by default (obsolete {{{--css-sugar}}})
 # Clean tags with no attributes by default (obsolete {{{--css-sugar}}})
 # Default CSS on headers (simple and pretty) if no style was specified by user
 # Better DIV names for the areas: {{{#header}}}, {{{#main}}}, {{{#footer?}}}, {{{.toc}}}
 # No use for an automatic footer DIV, since there isn't a Footer Area on the sources
 # Option {{{--id}}} (or something) to put an automatic unique id in every block (great for anchors, CSS and JavaScript): {{{<table id="table1">}}}
 # Mark table columns to make it easy to style them {{{<td class="col1">}}} or use colgroup
 # Mark table row to make it easy to style them, like zebra: {{{<tr class="odd">}}}

Code:

 # Move from TRANSITIONAL to STRICT
 # Use lowercase tags
 # Clean {{{<HR>}}} tag, no attributes
 # Tags and contents on the same line: {{{<p>...</p>}}} to make filters (pre/postproc) easier
 # Use only {{{id=}}} or {{{class=}}} on DIVs, not both (as today: {{{<DIV CLASS="body" ID="body">}}})
 # Remove A tag for anchors {{{<A NAME="foo"><H2>}}} and use id= attribute: {{{<H2 id="foo">}}}
 # B/I/S/U versus STRONG/EM/DEL/, there is a strong reason to change?
 # Prefer to use {{{style=}}} instead attributes for image: {{{<IMG ALIGN="right" BORDER="0">}}}
 # Remove the ugly: {{{<center><IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="img.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT=""></center>}}}
 # Always close the tags: {{{<li>...</li>}}}
 # Comment DIV closing to help filters and inspection: {{{</div><!-- main -->}}}

Features:

 # P inside quote for consecutive quoted paragraphs {{{<blockquote><p>...</p><p>...</p></blockquote>}}}
 # Or maybe just stick with {{{<br><br>}}} to separate the paragraphs
 # Maintain or remove support for spaced list items? {{{<p></p>}}} is ugly, what's the right way?
 # Map strong line ==== to simple ----? There is an use for it in HTML?
 # How to expand the link mark to specify a description? {{{<A TITLE="">}}}
 # How to expand the image mark to specify a description? {{{<IMG TITLE="" ALT="">}}}
 # {{{<br>}}} make a mark for it or not?
 # Any way to improve the default comment on footer? {{{<!-- html code generated by txt2tags...}}}
 # Allow remote images URL inside image mark

Settings:

 # Handy keywords to set HTML headers:
{{{
%!script: foo.js
%!favicon: foo.png
%!author: Mr. John Doe
%!keywords: surf, beach, wave, sun, summer
%!description: This page is about surf.
%!feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyNews
}}}

 # Or a more generic META keyword:
{{{
%!meta: keywords surf, beach, wave, sun, summer
%!meta: description This page is about surf.
%!meta: verify-v1 d1EROlU9dwR+0/W9nLC+A6GgiD7VAyCxZtfnXsTRwQc=
}}}
