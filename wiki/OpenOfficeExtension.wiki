To install it:

 * download the .oxt file at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=179652&package_id=209734
 * launch Openoffice Writer (for example)
 * in the menu, clic on the "Tools" entry
 * at the bottom of the menu, "handle extensions" (or something like that)
 * in the new window, clic on add an extension
 * select the .oxt file

You're done.

Now relaunch !OpenOffice Write, you'll see a new entry menu called "txt2tags": from there you can insert markup quickly.
