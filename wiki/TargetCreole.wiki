#summary Comments for the new target Creole

= Target Creole =

From the [http://www.wikicreole.org website] : "Creole is a common wiki markup language to be used across different wikis. It's not replacing existing markup but instead enabling wiki users to transfer content seamlessly across wikis, and for novice users to contribute more easily."

They have done a [http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Reasoning great work] to compare the syntax  over 60+ wiki engines.

Txt2tags supports 4 wiki engines (the  most important). Support all the existing wiki engines is bloated and probably a dead end.

Support Creole could be a fine answer.

Please add here your own comments, links and ideas about the adding of the new target Creole.
