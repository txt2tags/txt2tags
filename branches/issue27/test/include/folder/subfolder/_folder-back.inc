Folder - Level 2.
%%%
This should be ok now
%!include: folder/_folder-back.inc
%%%

%!include: ../_folder-back.inc

Now txt2tags does not considers "current path" the path for the mother .t2t file
(../../include-nesting-folder-back.t2t)

There is still the problem that there is no "include parent" check.
