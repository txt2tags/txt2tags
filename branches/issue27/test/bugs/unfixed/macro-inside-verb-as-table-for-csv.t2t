In targets that do not support tables (ie.: txt), txt2tags embed the full marked table inside a verbatim block, so it can still look pretty at output:

  | one | two  |
  | um  | dois |

Macros and other formatting are not allowed inside verbatim, but in this case the original mark was for a table, where user expect marks to be expanded. So macros and formatting is expanded on this table -> verbatim mapping. So

  | one | two | %%date |

Will turn to 

  | one | two | 20001231 |

on the txt target.

But this is not desired when the table comes from a CSV file, using the %!csv command. Macros and formatting should NEVER be expanded.

For table aware targets it's working ok (see test/csv/marked.t2t). But the table -> verbatim mapping is expanding the macros on txt target. So

  one,two,%%date

inside a CSV file, gives

  | one | two | 20001231 |

as output on txt target. The error is that the %%date macro should not be expanded.

This is tricky to fix, since at this point we're inside an exception inside the exception: csv -> table -> verbatim mapping.

For now, I'm just removing the %%date macro from the txt output.

This bug affects:
test/csv/marked.t2t
