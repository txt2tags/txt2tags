Txt2tags README File for Module Samples
---------------------------------------
http://txt2tags.org

The files on this directory are samples of Python scripts
using txt2tags as a module.

They are useful for Python programmers that want to embed
txt2tags functionality into their own programs.

The samples show how to prepare the marked text, set some
configurations, perform the conversion and handle
exceptions. Well, the code talks for itself.

To run this samples you must copy the txt2tags program to
this directory (or make a symlink) named as 'txt2tags.py'.
Then just do "python module-full.py" command or similar.

The author will be glad to know that you used txt2tags in
your program. Mail him!
